# How to run the application and tests

1. Ensure you are in the app directory by running `cd app`
2. Install dependencies by running `npm i`
3. Compile the TypeScript code by running `npm run build`
4. Start app in development mode by running `npm run dev`
5. Start app in production mode by running `npm run start`
6. Execute tests by running `npm test`

# Things to note

1. App CLI might freeze when running in IDE terminal, best to use native terminal.
2. If you run `npm run dev`, the text "ðŸ”‘ Enter your Staff Pass ID (or type 'exit' to quit):" will appear twice in dev mode. To only have it show once, run `npm run start` instead.
